radar \- NWS Doppler radar on the command line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
radar [sitecode|city] [\-l, \[en]list] [\-s, \[en]search regex] [\-u,
\[en]url sitecode|city] [\-h, \[en]help]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
radar is a tool for retrieving National Weather Service (NWS) Doppler
radar imagery from the command line.
It links to the \[lq]lite\[rq] version of the NWS RIDGE site and
retrieves the animated .GIF file showing about the last 30 minutes of
precipitation at the site you select.
You can specify an ICAO code directly (such as KNQA for Memphis
International Airport) or you can type a city name.
If there's a WSR\-88 site in that city, \f[B]radar\f[] will find it and
retrieve its imagery.
Cities with spaces in their names should be encapsulated in quotes, for
example \[lq]Los Angeles.\[rq]
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
[sitecode|city] \f[B]sitecode\f[] can be any ICAO code, such as KOKX for
New York City.
Site codes are case\-insensitive.
Alternatively, you can specify a \f[B]city\f[] and \f[B]radar\f[] will
do its best to locate its imagery.
Running `radar \[lq]New York\[rq]' gives identical results to `radar
KNQA'.
.PP
[\-l, \[en]list] Will print a list of every NEXRAD Doppler radar in the
United States, showing city, state, and ICAO code, to standard output.
This information is stored in /usr/local/radar/share/radars.txt.
.PP
[\-s, \[en]search regex] This is really a shortcut for `grep \-w regex
/usr/local/radar/share/radars.txt'.
Examples: `radar \-s TX:' will list all the sites in Texas; `radar \-s
AFB' will list all the sites at US Air Force bases.
.PP
[\-u, \[en]url sitecode|city] Just prints the URL of the radar imagery
to standard output instead of opening it with mpv(1).
.PP
[\-h, \[en]help] Prints an abbreviated set of usage instructions to
standard output.
.SH FILES
.PP
/usr/local/radar/share/radars.txt Contains information on all NEXRAD
sites in the United States.
Each line has the form `City, ST: KABC', where ST is the two\-letter
postal abbreviation for the state and KABC is the ICAO code.
.SH BUGS
.PP
\f[B]radar\f[] is a POSIX shell script.
On your system, /bin/sh must be a POSIX\-compliant shell for
\f[B]radar\f[] to work.
